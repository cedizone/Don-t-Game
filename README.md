# Gambling Simulator
The Gambling Simulator is a C++ program that helps users avoid wasting their money on gambling. The program allows users to play a gambling game without putting any actual money on it. Instead, users can simulate the game and see how much money they would have lost if it were a real gambling game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the repository directory and compile the program with the following command:


Copy code
```
g++ -o simulator main.cpp
```



3. Run the program with the following command:


Copy code
```
./simulator

```


## Usage
Once you have the program running, you can use the following commands to simulate a gambling game:

- bet <amount>: Place a bet of the specified amount on the gambling game.

- play: Play the gambling game.

- cashout: Cash out any winnings from the gambling game.

- reset: Reset the gambling game.

- exit: Exit the program.

The program will keep track of the user's balance and display it after each round of the gambling game. The program will also show the user how much money they would have lost if it were a real gambling game.
